<p>Navigable space determination is a difficult problem encountered in robotics and intelligent vehicle technology and it requires integrated solutions using advances in computer vision and computational geometry. 
  The conventional data processing workflow uses semantic segmentation to identify road points from three-dimensional (3D) automotive LiDAR point clouds, which have to be extended to determine its boundary points. 
  The boundary points are critical in getting an initial coarse extraction of its surface. Hence, to filter the curb or edge points from the road points, the semantic segmentation results are post-processed. 
  The road surface is determined by the entire trajectory information, which is captured as a sequence of LiDAR point clouds. 
  For the entire road surface extraction, we use an automated system, RoSELS (Road Surface Extraction for LiDAR point cloud Sequence) that works at different scales, i.e., at the scale of a point, a point cloud, and the sequence of point clouds. 
  In this paper, we evaluate the algorithms used in RoSELS, namely, the Gaussian Mixture Model for curb detection and ResNet-50 for transfer learning in frame classification. 
  We evaluate the quality of the mesh extracted using RoSELS, which is intended for straight-road geometry. 
  Here, we also show how the initial extracted surface can be further post-processed to extend RoSELS for curved roads.
